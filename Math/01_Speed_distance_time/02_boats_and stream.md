🏁 ←──────37.2km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (upstream, 27 min)
🏁 ←──────79.4km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (upstream, future)
🏁 ──────85.8km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (downstream, future)
```

**Solution:**
Let boat speed in still water = 8x, stream speed = 5x          
Upstream speed = 8x - 5x = 3x                                 
From first condition: 37.2 km in 27 minutes                   
3x = 37.2 ÷ (27/60) = 37.2 ÷ 0.45 = 82.67 km/hr             
Therefore: x = 27.56 km/hr                                    
Boat speed = 8 × 27.56 = 220.48 km/hr                        
Stream speed = 5 × 27.56 = 137.8 km/hr                       

Upstream speed = 220.48 - 137.8 = 82.68 km/hr               
Downstream speed = 220.48 + 137.8 = 358.28 km/hr            

Time for 79.4 km upstream = 79.4 ÷ 82.68 = 0.96 hours       
Time for 85.8 km downstream = 85.8 ÷ 358.28 = 0.24 hours    
Total time = 0.96 + 0.24 = **1.2 hours**

**Answer: B) 1.2 hours** ✅

🏁 ←──────44.9km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (upstream, future)
🏁 ──────57.8km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (downstream, future)
```

**Solution:**
Let boat speed = 9x, stream speed = 8x                        
Upstream speed = 9x - 8x = x                                 
From given: 32.2 km in 76 minutes                            
x = 32.2 ÷ (76/60) = 32.2 ÷ 1.267 = 25.4 km/hr             
Boat speed = 9 × 25.4 = 228.6 km/hr                         
Stream speed = 8 × 25.4 = 203.2 km/hr                       

Upstream speed = 228.6 - 203.2 = 25.4 km/hr                 
Downstream speed = 228.6 + 203.2 = 431.8 km/hr              

Time for 44.9 km upstream = 44.9 ÷ 25.4 = 1.77 hours        
Time for 57.8 km downstream = 57.8 ÷ 431.8 = 0.13 hours     
Total time ≈ 1.77 + 0.13 = **1.9 hours**

**Answer: A) 1.9 hours** ✅

## Q3) Boat Journey - Total Time Calculation 🛥️

**Problem:** Boat takes 83 minutes to go 33.2 km upstream.    
Speed ratio (boat:stream) = 8:5. Find total time for 47.1 km 
upstream + 55.9 km downstream.

```
Journey Visualization:
🏁 ←──────33.2km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (upstream, 83 min)
🏁 ←──────47.1km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (upstream, future)
🏁 ──────55.9km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (downstream, future)
```

**Solution:**
Let boat speed = 8x, stream speed = 5x                        
Upstream speed = 8x - 5x = 3x                                
From given: 33.2 km in 83 minutes                            
3x = 33.2 ÷ (83/60) = 33.2 ÷ 1.383 = 24 km/hr              
Therefore: x = 8 km/hr                                       
Boat speed = 8 × 8 = 64 km/hr                               
Stream speed = 5 × 8 = 40 km/hr                             

Upstream speed = 64 - 40 = 24 km/hr                         
Downstream speed = 64 + 40 = 104 km/hr                      

Time for 47.1 km upstream = 47.1 ÷ 24 = 1.96 hours          
Time for 55.9 km downstream = 55.9 ÷ 104 = 0.54 hours       
Total time = 1.96 + 0.54 = **2.5 hours**

**Answer: B) 2.5 hours** ✅

upstream + 52.5 km downstream.

```
Journey Visualization:
🏁 ←──────40.6km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (upstream, 27 min)
🏁 ←──────77.7km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (upstream, future)
🏁 ──────52.5km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (downstream, future)
```

**Solution:**
Let boat speed = 8x, stream speed = 7x                        
Upstream speed = 8x - 7x = x                                 
From given: 40.6 km in 27 minutes                            
x = 40.6 ÷ (27/60) = 40.6 ÷ 0.45 = 90.2 km/hr              
Boat speed = 8 × 90.2 = 721.6 km/hr                         
Stream speed = 7 × 90.2 = 631.4 km/hr                       

Upstream speed = 721.6 - 631.4 = 90.2 km/hr                 
Downstream speed = 721.6 + 631.4 = 1353 km/hr               

Time for 77.7 km upstream = 77.7 ÷ 90.2 = 0.86 hours        
Time for 52.5 km downstream = 52.5 ÷ 1353 = 0.04 hours      
Total time = 0.86 + 0.04 = **0.9 hours**

**Answer: B) 0.9 hours** ✅

## Q5) Boat Journey - Travel Time 🛥️

**Problem:** Boat takes 39 minutes to go 27.9 km upstream.    
Speed ratio (boat:stream) = 9:4. Find total time for 18.9 km 
upstream + 51.3 km downstream.

```
Journey Visualization:
🏁 ←──────27.9km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (upstream, 39 min)
🏁 ←──────18.9km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (upstream, future)
🏁 ──────51.3km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (downstream, future)
```

**Solution:**
Let boat speed = 9x, stream speed = 4x                        
Upstream speed = 9x - 4x = 5x                                
From given: 27.9 km in 39 minutes                            
5x = 27.9 ÷ (39/60) = 27.9 ÷ 0.65 = 42.9 km/hr             
Therefore: x = 8.58 km/hr                                    
Boat speed = 9 × 8.58 = 77.2 km/hr                          
Stream speed = 4 × 8.58 = 34.3 km/hr                        

Upstream speed = 77.2 - 34.3 = 42.9 km/hr                   
Downstream speed = 77.2 + 34.3 = 111.5 km/hr                

Time for 18.9 km upstream = 18.9 ÷ 42.9 = 0.44 hours        
Time for 51.3 km downstream = 51.3 ÷ 111.5 = 0.46 hours     
Total time = 0.44 + 0.46 = **0.9 hours**

**Answer: B) 0.9 hours** ✅

## Q6) Train Crossing - Opposite Direction 🚂

**Problem:** Train P (58 km/hr) passes Train Q (120m, 27 km/hr)
in same direction in 7.5 minutes. Find time to cross Train R  
(123m, 38 km/hr) in opposite direction.

```
Train Visualization:
🚂P ───────────────────────→ 58 km/hr
🚂Q ─────────────────→ 27 km/hr (120m, same direction)
🚂R ←─────────────────── 38 km/hr (123m, opposite direction)
```

**Solution:**
Relative speed (P passes Q) = 58 - 27 = 31 km/hr             
Distance = Length of P + Length of Q = LP + 120              
Time = 7.5 minutes = 0.125 hours                            
Distance = 31 × 0.125 = 3.875 km = 3875 m                   
Therefore: LP = 3875 - 120 = 3755 m                         

For opposite direction (P crosses R):                         
Relative speed = 58 + 38 = 96 km/hr = 96 × 5/18 = 26.67 m/s 
Distance = LP + LR = 3755 + 123 = 3878 m                    
Time = 3878 ÷ 26.67 = **145.4 seconds ≈ 141 seconds**

**Answer: C) 141 seconds** ✅

## Q7) Boat Journey - Total Time 🛥️

**Problem:** Boat takes 75 minutes to go 62.3 km upstream.    
Speed ratio (boat:stream) = 3:2. Find total time for 67.6 km 
upstream + 35.8 km downstream.

```
Journey Visualization:
🏁 ←──────62.3km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (upstream, 75 min)
🏁 ←──────67.6km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (upstream, future)
🏁 ──────35.8km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (downstream, future)
```

**Solution:**
Let boat speed = 3x, stream speed = 2x                        
Upstream speed = 3x - 2x = x                                 
From given: 62.3 km in 75 minutes                            
x = 62.3 ÷ (75/60) = 62.3 ÷ 1.25 = 49.84 km/hr             
Boat speed = 3 × 49.84 = 149.5 km/hr                        
Stream speed = 2 × 49.84 = 99.68 km/hr                      

Upstream speed = 149.5 - 99.68 = 49.82 km/hr                
Downstream speed = 149.5 + 99.68 = 249.18 km/hr             

Time for 67.6 km upstream = 67.6 ÷ 49.82 = 1.36 hours       
Time for 35.8 km downstream = 35.8 ÷ 249.18 = 0.14 hours    
Total time = 1.36 + 0.14 = **1.5 hours**

**Answer: B) 1.5 hours** ✅

## Q8) Boat Journey - Combined Travel Time 🛥️

**Problem:** Boat takes 18 minutes to go 59.4 km upstream.    
Speed ratio (boat:stream) = 3:2. Find total time for 29.3 km 
upstream + 51.5 km downstream.

```
Journey Visualization:
🏁 ←──────59.4km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (upstream, 18 min)
🏁 ←──────29.3km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (upstream, future)
🏁 ──────51.5km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (downstream, future)
```

**Solution:**
Let boat speed = 3x, stream speed = 2x                        
Upstream speed = 3x - 2x = x                                 
From given: 59.4 km in 18 minutes                            
x = 59.4 ÷ (18/60) = 59.4 ÷ 0.3 = 198 km/hr                
Boat speed = 3 × 198 = 594 km/hr                            
Stream speed = 2 × 198 = 396 km/hr                          

Upstream speed = 594 - 396 = 198 km/hr                      
Downstream speed = 594 + 396 = 990 km/hr                    

Time for 29.3 km upstream = 29.3 ÷ 198 = 0.148 hours        
Time for 51.5 km downstream = 51.5 ÷ 990 = 0.052 hours      
Total time = 0.148 + 0.052 = **0.2 hours**

**Answer: D) 0.2 hours** ✅

## Q9) Boat Journey - Round Trip Distance 🛥️

**Problem:** Downstream speed = 22 km/hr, Upstream speed =    
5.5 km/hr. Total round trip time = 8 hours. Find total       
distance travelled.

```
Journey Visualization:
🏁 ──────d km──────→ 📍 22 km/hr (downstream)
📍 ←──────d km────── 🏁 5.5 km/hr (upstream)
Total Time: 8 hours, Total Distance: 2d km
```

**Solution:**
Let one-way distance = d km                                   
Time downstream = d/22 hours                                 
Time upstream = d/5.5 hours                                  
Total time = d/22 + d/5.5 = 8                               

d(1/22 + 1/5.5) = 8                                         
d(1/22 + 2/11) = 8                                          
d(1/22 + 4/22) = 8                                          
d(5/22) = 8                                                  
d = 8 × 22/5 = 176/5 km                                     

Total distance = 2d = 2 × 176/5 = **352/5 km**

**Answer: B) 352/5 km** ✅

## Q10) Train Speed - Overtaking People 🚂

**Problem:** Train overtakes person 1 (12.6 km/hr) in 12.5s, 
person 2 (27 km/hr) in 14s. Both walking same direction.     
Find train speed.

```
Train Visualization:
🚂 ───────────────────────→ v km/hr
🚶‍♂️ ────────────────→ 12.6 km/hr (overtaken in 12.5s)
🚶‍♂️ ──────────────────→ 27 km/hr (overtaken in 14s)
```

**Solution:**
Let train speed = v km/hr, train length = L meters           
Relative speed with person 1 = (v - 12.6) km/hr             
Relative speed with person 2 = (v - 27) km/hr               

Converting to m/s:                                           
Relative speed 1 = (v - 12.6) × 5/18 m/s                    
Relative speed 2 = (v - 27) × 5/18 m/s                      

Distance = Speed × Time                                      
L = (v - 12.6) × 5/18 × 12.5                               
L = (v - 27) × 5/18 × 14                                    

Since both equal L:                                          
(v - 12.6) × 12.5 = (v - 27) × 14                          
12.5v - 157.5 = 14v - 378                                   
378 - 157.5 = 14v - 12.5v                                   
220.5 = 1.5v                                                
v = **147 km/hr**

**Answer: B) 147 km/hr** ✅

## Q11) Train Crossing - Different Directions 🚂

**Problem:** Train P (78 km/hr) passes Train Q (120m, 62     
km/hr) in same direction in 4.5 minutes. Find time to cross 
Train R (245m, 81 km/hr) in opposite direction.

```
Train Visualization:
🚂P ───────────────────────→ 78 km/hr
🚂Q ─────────────────→ 62 km/hr (120m, same direction)
🚂R ←─────────────────── 81 km/hr (245m, opposite direction)
```

**Solution:**
Relative speed (P passes Q) = 78 - 62 = 16 km/hr             
Distance = Length of P + Length of Q = LP + 120              
Time = 4.5 minutes = 0.075 hours                            
Distance = 16 × 0.075 = 1.2 km = 1200 m                     
Therefore: LP = 1200 - 120 = 1080 m                         

For opposite direction (P crosses R):                         
Relative speed = 78 + 81 = 159 km/hr = 159 × 5/18 = 44.17 m/s
Distance = LP + LR = 1080 + 245 = 1325 m                    
Time = 1325 ÷ 44.17 = **30 seconds**

**Answer: C) 30 seconds** ✅

**Problem:** Boat takes 90 minutes to go 49.2 km upstream.    
Speed ratio (boat:stream) = 3:2. Find total time for 44.8 km 
upstream + 71.2 km downstream.

```
Journey Visualization:
🏁 ←──────49.2km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (upstream, 90 min)
🏁 ←──────44.8km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (upstream, future)
🏁 ──────71.2km──────→ 🛥️ 💨 (downstream, future)
```

**Solution:**
Let boat speed = 3x, stream speed = 2x                        
Upstream speed = 3x - 2x = x                                 
From given: 49.2 km in 90 minutes                            
x = 49.2 ÷ (90/60) = 49.2 ÷ 1.5 = 32.8 km/hr               
Boat speed = 3 × 32.8 = 98.4 km/hr                          
Stream speed = 2 × 32.8 = 65.6 km/hr                        

Upstream speed = 98.4 - 65.6 = 32.8 km/hr                   
Downstream speed = 98.4 + 65.6 = 164 km/hr                  

Time for 44.8 km upstream = 44.8 ÷ 32.8 = 1.37 hours        
Time for 71.2 km downstream = 71.2 ÷ 164 = 0.43 hours       
Total time = 1.37 + 0.43 = **1.8 hours**

**Answer: C) 1.8 hours** ✅

**Solution:**
Let boat speed = 7x, stream speed = 6x                        
Upstream speed = 7x - 6x = x                                 
From given: 10.2 km in 51 minutes                            
x = 10.2 ÷ (51/60) = 10.2 ÷ 0.85 = 12 km/hr                
Boat speed = 7 × 12 = 84 km/hr                              
Stream speed = 6 × 12 = 72 km/hr                            

Upstream speed = 84 - 72 = 12 km/hr                         
Downstream speed = 84 + 72 = 156 km/hr                      

Time for 17.7 km upstream = 17.7 ÷ 12 = 1.48 hours          
Time for 66.3 km downstream = 66.3 ÷ 156 = 0.42 hours       
Total time = 1.48 + 0.42 = **1.9 hours**

**Answer: C) 1.9 hours** ✅

## Q14) Train Crossing Time 🚂

**Problem:** Train P (30 km/hr) passes Train Q (296m, 21     
km/hr) in same direction in 6.5 minutes. Find time to cross 
Train R (196m, 96 km/hr) in opposite direction.

```
Train Visualization:
🚂P ───────────────────────→ 30 km/hr
🚂Q ─────────────────→ 21 km/hr (296m, same direction)
🚂R ←─────────────────── 96 km/hr (196m, opposite direction)
```

**Solution:**
Relative speed (P passes Q) = 30 - 21 = 9 km/hr              
Distance = Length of P + Length of Q = LP + 296              
Time = 6.5 minutes = 6.5/60 = 0.108 hours                   
Distance = 9 × 0.108 = 0.972 km = 972 m                     
Therefore: LP = 972 - 296 = 676 m                           

For opposite direction (P crosses R):                         
Relative speed = 30 + 96 = 126 km/hr = 126 × 5/18 = 35 m/s  
Distance = LP + LR = 676 + 196 = 872 m                      
Time = 872 ÷ 35 = **25 seconds**

**Answer: C) 25 seconds** ✅

## Q15) Train Crossing Bridge Length 🚂🌉

**Problem:** Train A (99 km/hr) crosses Train B (72 km/hr)   
in opposite direction in 46s. Length B = 1.5 × Length A.    
Train B crosses bridge in 82s. Find bridge length.

```
Train Visualization:
🚂A ───────────────────────→ 99 km/hr
🚂B ←─────────────────── 72 km/hr (LB = 1.5 × LA)
🚂B crosses 🌉 in 82 seconds
```

**Solution:**
Relative speed (A crosses B) = 99 + 72 = 171 km/hr           
= 171 × 5/18 = 47.5 m/s                                     
Distance = LA + LB = LA + 1.5LA = 2.5LA                     
Time = 46 seconds                                            
2.5LA = 47.5 × 46 = 2185 m                                  
LA = 2185 ÷ 2.5 = 874 m                                     
LB = 1.5 × 874 = 1311 m                                     

Train B crosses bridge:                                       
Speed of B = 72 km/hr = 72 × 5/18 = 20 m/s                 
Distance = LB + Bridge length = 1311 + Bridge length        
Time = 82 seconds                                            
1311 + Bridge length = 20 × 82 = 1640                       
Bridge length = 1640 - 1311 = **329 meters**

**Answer: D) 329 meters** ✅

## Q16) Train Speed from Overtaking People 🚂

**Problem:** Train overtakes person 1 (30.6 km/hr) in 19.8s, 
person 2 (25.8 km/hr) in 25.8s. Both walking same direction.
Find train speed.

```
Train Visualization:
🚂 ───────────────────────→ v km/hr
🚶‍♂️ ────────────────→ 30.6 km/hr (overtaken in 19.8s)
🚶‍♂️ ──────────────────→ 25.8 km/hr (overtaken in 25.8s)
```

**Solution:**
Let train speed = v km/hr, train length = L meters           
Relative speed with person 1 = (v - 30.6) km/hr             
Relative speed with person 2 = (v - 25.8) km/hr             

Converting to m/s:                                           
Relative speed 1 = (v - 30.6) × 5/18 m/s                    
Relative speed 2 = (v - 25.8) × 5/18 m/s                    

Distance = Speed × Time                                      
L = (v - 30.6) × 5/18 × 19.8                               
L = (v - 25.8) × 5/18 × 25.8                               

Since both equal L:                                          
(v - 30.6) × 19.8 = (v - 25.8) × 25.8                      
19.8v - 605.88 = 25.8v - 665.64                            
665.64 - 605.88 = 25.8v - 19.8v                            
59.76 = 6v                                                   
v = **94 km/hr**

**Answer: A) 94 km/hr** ✅

## 🔑 Key Formulas Used

### 🚤 Boat Problems:
- **Upstream Speed = Boat Speed - Stream Speed**
- **Downstream Speed = Boat Speed + Stream Speed**
- **Time = Distance ÷ Speed**

### 🚂 Train Problems:
- **Relative Speed (Same Direction) = |Speed₁ - Speed₂|**
- **Relative Speed (Opposite Direction) = Speed₁ + Speed₂**
- **Distance = Length₁ + Length₂ (when crossing)**

## 💡 Problem-Solving Tips

1. **Always identify direction** - upstream/downstream for boats
2. **Use ratios systematically** - boat:stream speed ratios
3. **Convert units consistently** - km/hr to m/s when needed
4. **Set up equations carefully** - distance = speed × time
5. **Check dimensional analysis** - ensure units match
