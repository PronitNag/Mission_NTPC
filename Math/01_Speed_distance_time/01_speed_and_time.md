at 66 km/hr, and the remaining journey at 17 km/hr. What is the 
average speed?

```
🧍‍♂️ ----[67 km/hr]---- ----[66 km/hr]---- ----[17 km/hr]----
     |     1/3 journey    |    1/3 journey   |   1/3 journey  |
     Start               Point A            Point B          End
```

**Solution:** 
Let total distance = 3d
- Time for 1st segment: d/67 hours
- Time for 2nd segment: d/66 hours  
- Time for 3rd segment: d/17 hours
- Total time = d/67 + d/66 + d/17 = d(1/67 + 1/66 + 1/17)
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 3d / [d(1/67 + 1/66 + 1/17)]
- = 3 / (1/67 + 1/66 + 1/17) = 3 / (0.0149 + 0.0151 + 0.0588) = 3/0.1049

                            ↗️
<----[? km/hr]---- 🧍‍♂️ (Coming opposite)
```

**Solution:**
Let man's speed = v km/hr
- Distance between cabs when 2nd cab starts = 74 × (28/60) = 74 × 7/15 km
- In 12 mins, relative speed closes this gap
- Relative speed = 74 + v km/hr
- Distance = Speed × Time
- 74 × 7/15 = (74 + v) × 12/60
- 74 × 7/15 = (74 + v) × 1/5
- 74 × 7/15 = (74 + v)/5
- 74 × 7 × 5/15 = 74 + v
- 74 × 7/3 = 74 + v
- 172.67 = 74 + v

      🏃‍♂️←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←🏃‍♂️
     Yash (45s/lap)     Meeting Point
```

**Solution:**
- Siddharth's speed = 2295/85 = 27 m/s
- Yash's speed = 2295/45 = 51 m/s
- Relative speed = 27 + 51 = 78 m/s (opposite directions)
- Time between meetings = 2295/78 = 29.42 s
- In one complete lap by slower runner (85s):
- Number of meetings = 85/29.42 = 2.89 ≈ 3
- But we need distinct meeting points
- LCM of lap times = LCM(85, 45) = 765s
- In 765s: Siddharth completes 765/85 = 9 laps
- Yash completes 765/45 = 17 laps
- Total relative laps = 9 + 17 = 26

## Q18: Two People's Speed Comparison 🏃‍♂️

**Problem:** Anirudh takes 3 hours more than Burhan to cover 90 km. 
If Anirudh doubles his speed, he takes 2 hours less than Burhan. 
Anirudh's initial speed?

```
🏃‍♂️ Anirudh: ----[v km/hr]---- (takes t+3 hours)
                                 
🏃‍♂️ Burhan:  ----[? km/hr]---- (takes t hours)
               |<----- 90 km ---->|
```

**Solution:**
Let Anirudh's speed = v km/hr, Burhan's time = t hours
- Anirudh's time = t + 3 hours
- Distance equation: v(t + 3) = 90, so t = 90/v - 3
- Burhan's speed = 90/t km/hr
- When Anirudh doubles speed: 2v × (t - 2) = 90
- So t - 2 = 90/(2v) = 45/v, hence t = 45/v + 2
- Equating: 90/v - 3 = 45/v + 2
- 90/v - 45/v = 5
- 45/v = 5
- v = 9 km/hr

**Answer:** Anirudh's initial speed is **6 km/hr** 🏃‍♂️

Abhay's initial speed?

```
🏃‍♂️ Abhay:  ----[v km/hr]---- (takes t+6 hours)
                                 
🏃‍♂️ Sameer: ----[? km/hr]---- (takes t hours)
              |<----- 162 km ---->|
```

**Solution:**
Let Abhay's speed = v km/hr, Sameer's time = t hours
- Abhay's time = t + 6 hours
- Distance equation: v(t + 6) = 162, so t = 162/v - 6
- Sameer's speed = 162/t km/hr
- When Abhay doubles speed: 2v × (t - 3) = 162
- So t - 3 = 162/(2v) = 81/v, hence t = 81/v + 3
- Equating: 162/v - 6 = 81/v + 3
- 162/v - 81/v = 9
- 81/v = 9
- v = 9 km/hr

**Answer:** Abhay's initial speed is **9 km/hr** 🏃‍♂️
