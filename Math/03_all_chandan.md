Please note, due to the large volume of questions in your sources, I will provide detailed solutions for a few representative questions from each chapter. This will help you understand the problem-solving approach and desired format. Solving all questions comprehensively would exceed typical response limits. 📚

Here are examples following your instructions:

### Number System

**Q1) Nandan had some marbles. When he distributed the marbles equally among 32 children, he found that 4 marbles were left. Had he distributed the marbles equally among 41 children and 48 children, he still would have had 13 and 20 marbles, respectively, left with him. But when he distributed them equally among 53 children, no marble was left. The number of marbles that Nandan initially had may lie between __________.**

**Detailed Solution:**

Nandan ke paas kuch marbles the. Let's call the total marbles 'N'.

Condition 1️⃣:
When distributed among 32 children, 4 marbles left.
So, N = 32k₁ + 4.
This can also be written as N = 32k₁ - 28.
Kyunki (32 - 4) = 28. ⚪⚪⚪

Condition 2️⃣:
When distributed among 41 children, 13 marbles left.
So, N = 41k₂ + 13.
This means N = 41k₂ - 28.
Kyunki (41 - 13) = 28. 🤩

Condition 3️⃣:
When distributed among 48 children, 20 marbles left.
So, N = 48k₃ + 20.
This means N = 48k₃ - 28.
Kyunki (48 - 20) = 28. 👍

From these three conditions, we know that (N + 28) must be divisible by 32, 41, and 48.
Toh, N + 28 = LCM(32, 41, 48) ka multiple hoga.

Let's find the LCM (Least Common Multiple):
32 = 2⁵
41 = 41 (yeh toh prime hai!)
48 = 16 × 3 = 2⁴ × 3

LCM(32, 41, 48) = 2⁵ × 3 × 41 = 32 × 3 × 41 = 96 × 41 = 3936.
So, N + 28 = 3936m, where 'm' koi positive integer hai.
N = 3936m - 28. 🤔

Condition 4️⃣:
When distributed among 53 children, no marble left.
Iska matlab, N is completely divisible by 53.
Let's check values for 'm':

If m = 1:
N = 3936(1) - 28 = 3936 - 28 = 3908.
Check divisibility by 53: 3908 ÷ 53 = 73.73... (Pura divide nahi hua) ❌

If m = 2:
N = 3936(2) - 28 = 7872 - 28 = 7844.
Check divisibility by 53: 7844 ÷ 53 = 148. (Yes! Pura divide ho gaya) ✅

So, the number of marbles Nandan had is **7844**.
Now, let's see kis range mein aata hai.
A) 7814 and 7824
B) 7794 and 7804
C) 7864 and 7874
D) 7834 and 7854

The number **7844** lies between **7834 and 7854**.

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{7834 and 7854}}$.

**Q10) The simplified value of 48 - (-18) × (-60 - 72 - 92) ÷ [8 × { 2 + (-6) × (-9)}] is:**
**A) 34 B) 39 C) 36 D) 37**

**Detailed Solution:**

Let's simplify this expression using **BODMAS** rule.
BODMAS order hai: Brackets, Orders (powers/roots), Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction. 🪜

Expression: 48 - (-18) × (-60 - 72 - 92) ÷ [8 × { 2 + (-6) × (-9)}]

**Step 1: Solve the innermost brackets.**
(-6) × (-9) = 54 (minus minus plus ho gaya) 😄
So, { 2 + (-6) × (-9)} becomes {2 + 54} = 56.

Now the expression is: 48 - (-18) × (-60 - 72 - 92) ÷ [8 × 56].

**Step 2: Solve the other brackets.**
(-60 - 72 - 92) = -224 (sab negative, toh add karke negative) ➖
[8 × 56] = 448.

Now the expression is: 48 - (-18) × (-224) ÷ 448.

**Step 3: Perform Multiplication and Division from left to right.**
(-18) × (-224) = 4032 (minus minus plus) ✅
So, 4032 ÷ 448.

**Step 4: Perform the Division.**
4032 ÷ 448 = 9.

Now the expression is: 48 - 9.

**Step 5: Perform the Subtraction.**
48 - 9 = 39.

The simplified value is **39**.

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{39}}$.

### Percentage

**Q33) 2% of 50% of a number is what percentage of that number?**
**A) 100% B) 0.1% C) 1% D) 52%**

**Detailed Solution:**

Let's assume the number is 'X'. 🤔

First, find 50% of X:
50% of X = (50/100) * X = 0.5 * X.

Next, find 2% of the result (0.5 * X):
2% of (0.5 * X) = (2/100) * (0.5 * X).
= 0.02 * 0.5 * X.

Now, multiply the decimal values:
0.02 * 0.5 = 0.01.

So, 2% of 50% of X is 0.01 * X.

To express this as a percentage of X, multiply by 100:
(0.01 * X / X) * 100% = 0.01 * 100% = **1%**.

So, 2% of 50% of a number is **1%** of that number. ✨

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{1%}}$.

**Q78) Kiran spends 45% of his income. If he saves ₹66,000, then his income (in ₹) is:**
**A) 1,21,000 B) 1,19,000 C) 29,700 D) 1,20,000**

**Detailed Solution:**

Kiran ki income ka breakdown dekhte hain:
Total Income = Expenditure + Savings. 💰

Given: Kiran spends 45% of his income.
Iska matlab, uska expenditure = 45% of Total Income.

Agar 45% spend kar diya, toh kitna save kiya?
Savings Percentage = 100% - Expenditure Percentage.
Savings Percentage = 100% - 45% = 55%.

We are given that his savings are ₹66,000.
So, 55% of his Total Income = ₹66,000.

Let Total Income be 'I'.
0.55 * I = 66,000.

To find Total Income (I), divide savings by the savings percentage:
I = 66,000 / 0.55.
I = 66,000 / (55/100).
I = (66,000 * 100) / 55.
I = (6600000) / 55.

Let's simplify the fraction:
66,000 / 55 = 1,200.
So, I = 1,200 * 100 = **₹1,20,000**.

Kiran ki total income **₹1,20,000** hai.

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{1,20,000}}$.

### Ratio and Proportion

**Q1) Rahul’s age is three times the age of his daughter. After 8 years from now, his age will be 5 years more than twice the age of his daughter. Find the present age of Rahul.**
**A) 36 years B) 30 years C) 33 years D) 39 years**

**Detailed Solution:**

Let's denote Rahul's present age as R and his daughter's present age as D.
R for Rahul, D for Daughter. 👨‍👧

**Given Information 1:**
Rahul's age is three times the age of his daughter.
R = 3D. (Equation 1)

**Given Information 2:**
After 8 years from now, his age will be 5 years more than twice the age of his daughter.
Rahul's age after 8 years = R + 8.
Daughter's age after 8 years = D + 8.

So, the equation becomes:
R + 8 = 2(D + 8) + 5. (Equation 2)

Now, we have a system of two equations.
Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:
(3D) + 8 = 2(D + 8) + 5.

Let's solve for D:
3D + 8 = 2D + 16 + 5.
3D + 8 = 2D + 21.

Subtract 2D from both sides:
3D - 2D + 8 = 21.
D + 8 = 21.

Subtract 8 from both sides:
D = 21 - 8.
D = 13 years. (This is the daughter's present age) 👧

Now find Rahul's present age using Equation 1 (R = 3D):
R = 3 * 13.
R = **39 years**. (This is Rahul's present age) 👨

Let's verify:
Daughter's current age = 13. Rahul's current age = 39. (3 * 13 = 39, correct).
After 8 years:
Daughter's age = 13 + 8 = 21.
Rahul's age = 39 + 8 = 47.
Is Rahul's age (47) 5 more than twice daughter's age (2*21 + 5)?
2 * 21 + 5 = 42 + 5 = 47. Yes, it matches! ✅

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{39 years}}$.

**Q48) If 260 is the mean proportion between x and 338, what is the value of x?**
**A) 200 B) 198 C) 199 D) 201**

**Detailed Solution:**

Mean proportion ka matlab hai, if 'b' is the mean proportion between 'a' and 'c',
toh a : b :: b : c hota hai. Iska matlab b² = ac.
Yahan, b = 260, a = x, aur c = 338.

So, the formula is: (Mean Proportion)² = First Number × Second Number.
(260)² = x × 338.

Let's calculate (260)²:
260 × 260 = 67600.

Now, we have:
67600 = x × 338.

To find x, divide 67600 by 338:
x = 67600 / 338.

Let's perform the division:
67600 ÷ 338.
Notice that 676 is exactly twice of 338 (338 * 2 = 676).
So, 67600 ÷ 338 = 200.

Thus, x = **200**.

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{200}}$.

### Profit and Loss

**Q1) If the selling price of a bed is 2-times of initial, then the profit is 7-times of initial. Find the initial profit percentage (in %).**
**A) 250 B) 20 C) 28.57 D) 350**

**Detailed Solution:**

Let's denote the initial values:
Initial Selling Price = SP₁.
Initial Cost Price = CP.
Initial Profit = P₁ = SP₁ - CP.

Now, according to the problem:
New Selling Price = SP₂ = 2 × SP₁.
New Profit = P₂ = 7 × P₁.

Also, we know that Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price.
So, P₂ = SP₂ - CP.

Substitute the new values into the profit formula:
7 × P₁ = 2 × SP₁ - CP.

We also know P₁ = SP₁ - CP, so CP = SP₁ - P₁.
Substitute CP in the equation:
7P₁ = 2SP₁ - (SP₁ - P₁).
7P₁ = 2SP₁ - SP₁ + P₁.
7P₁ = SP₁ + P₁.

Now, subtract P₁ from both sides:
7P₁ - P₁ = SP₁.
6P₁ = SP₁.

This tells us that the initial selling price is 6 times the initial profit.
Initial Profit Percentage ka formula hai:
Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100%.

We need to find CP in terms of P₁.
Since 6P₁ = SP₁, substitute this into P₁ = SP₁ - CP:
P₁ = 6P₁ - CP.
CP = 6P₁ - P₁.
CP = 5P₁.

Ab profit percentage calculate karte hain:
Initial Profit Percentage = (P₁ / CP) * 100%.
Initial Profit Percentage = (P₁ / 5P₁) * 100%.
Initial Profit Percentage = (1/5) * 100%.
Initial Profit Percentage = **20%**. 📈

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{20}}$.

**Q95) An article’s cost price is ₹285, and the marked price is mentioned as ₹1,140. What is the profit percentage of the seller if he sells it by allowing a discount of 70% on the marked price?**

**Detailed Solution:**

Given details:
Cost Price (CP) = ₹285.
Marked Price (MP) = ₹1,140.
Discount Percentage = 70%.

First, let's find the Selling Price (SP) after the discount.
Discount Amount = Discount Percentage of Marked Price.
Discount Amount = 70% of ₹1,140.
Discount Amount = (70/100) * 1,140 = 0.70 * 1,140 = ₹798.

Now, calculate the Selling Price:
Selling Price (SP) = Marked Price - Discount Amount.
SP = 1,140 - 798 = ₹342.

Ab, we have Cost Price (CP) = ₹285 and Selling Price (SP) = ₹342.
Since SP > CP, there is a profit.

Calculate the Profit Amount:
Profit = SP - CP.
Profit = 342 - 285 = ₹57.

Finally, calculate the Profit Percentage:
Profit Percentage = (Profit / CP) * 100%.
Profit Percentage = (57 / 285) * 100%.

Let's simplify the fraction 57/285.
Both are divisible by 57 (57 * 1 = 57, 57 * 5 = 285).
So, 57/285 = 1/5.

Profit Percentage = (1/5) * 100% = **20%**. 💰

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{20%}}$.

### Discount

**Q14) The successive discounts of 28%, 20% and 10% are equivalent to a single discount of:**
**A) 50.59% B) 48.16% C) 46.1% D) 46.69%**

**Detailed Solution:**

To find a single equivalent discount for successive discounts, we can use a formula or calculate step-by-step. Let's do it step-by-step for clarity. 🪜

Assume the Marked Price (MP) is ₹100.
Discount 1 = 28%.
After 1st discount, price = MP * (100 - 28)/100 = 100 * 72/100 = ₹72.

Discount 2 = 20% on the new price (₹72).
Discount amount 2 = 20% of 72 = (20/100) * 72 = 0.20 * 72 = ₹14.40.
After 2nd discount, price = 72 - 14.40 = ₹57.60.

Discount 3 = 10% on the latest price (₹57.60).
Discount amount 3 = 10% of 57.60 = (10/100) * 57.60 = 0.10 * 57.60 = ₹5.76.
After 3rd discount, final selling price = 57.60 - 5.76 = ₹51.84.

Initial Marked Price = ₹100.
Final Selling Price = ₹51.84.

Total Discount Amount = Initial MP - Final SP.
Total Discount Amount = 100 - 51.84 = ₹48.16.

Equivalent Single Discount Percentage = (Total Discount Amount / Initial MP) * 100%.
Equivalent Single Discount Percentage = (48.16 / 100) * 100% = **48.16%**. 🛍️

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{48.16%}}$.

### Simple and Compound Interest

**Q22) Find the simple interest (in ₹) on ₹900 at an interest rate of 6% per month in 12 months.**
**A) 108 B) 648 C) 54 D) 74**

**Detailed Solution:**

Simple interest (SI) calculate karne ka formula hai:
SI = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100. 🏦

Given values:
Principal (P) = ₹900.
Rate (R) = 6% per month.
Time (T) = 12 months.

Since the rate is per month and time is in months, we can directly use these values.
SI = (900 × 6 × 12) / 100.

Let's calculate:
900 × 6 = 5400.
5400 × 12 = 64800.

Now divide by 100:
SI = 64800 / 100 = **₹648**.

The simple interest is **₹648**.

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{648}}$.

---

**Q71) If at the same rate of interest, in 2 years, the simple interest is ₹40 and compound interest, compounded annually, is ₹42, then what is the principal (in ₹)?**
**A) 200 B) 193 C) 195 D) 204**

**Detailed Solution:**

Given:
Simple Interest (SI) for 2 years = ₹40.
Compound Interest (CI) for 2 years = ₹42.
Time (T) = 2 years.

For simple interest, the interest earned each year is the same.
So, SI for 1 year = Total SI / 2 = ₹40 / 2 = ₹20.

Now, consider the compound interest.
CI for 2 years = SI for 1st year + (SI for 2nd year + Interest on 1st year's interest).
The extra amount in CI compared to SI is the interest earned on the first year's simple interest.
Difference (CI - SI) = 42 - 40 = ₹2.

This ₹2 is the interest earned on the ₹20 (which was the SI of the first year).
So, ₹2 is the interest on ₹20 for 1 year.
Let the rate of interest be R%.

Using the simple interest formula: Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100.
2 = (20 × R × 1) / 100.
2 = 20R / 100.
2 = R / 5.
R = 2 × 5 = **10%**. (This is the annual interest rate)

Now that we have the rate, we can find the principal (P).
We know SI for 1 year is ₹20.
Using SI formula for 1 year: SI = (P × R × T) / 100.
20 = (P × 10 × 1) / 100.
20 = 10P / 100.
20 = P / 10.

Multiply both sides by 10:
P = 20 × 10 = **₹200**.

The principal amount is **₹200**.

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{200}}$.

### Distance, Time, and Speed

**Q18) In covering a distance of 90 km, Anirudh takes 3 hours more than Burhan. If Anirudh doubles his speed, then he would take 2 hours less than Burhan. Anirudh's initial speed is:**
**A) 18 km/hr B) 6 km/hr C) 9 km/hr D) 2 km/hr**

**Detailed Solution:**

Let Anirudh's initial speed be A km/hr. 🚴‍♂️
Let Burhan's speed be B km/hr. 🏃‍♂️
Distance (D) = 90 km.

Time = Distance / Speed.

**Condition 1:**
Anirudh takes 3 hours more than Burhan.
Time_Anirudh = 90/A.
Time_Burhan = 90/B.
So, 90/A = 90/B + 3. (Equation 1)

**Condition 2:**
If Anirudh doubles his speed (2A), he takes 2 hours less than Burhan.
New Time_Anirudh = 90/(2A).
So, 90/(2A) = 90/B - 2. (Equation 2)

From Equation 1, we can write 90/B = 90/A - 3.
Substitute this into Equation 2:
90/(2A) = (90/A - 3) - 2.
90/(2A) = 90/A - 5.

Let's solve for A.
Multiply the entire equation by 2A to clear denominators:
90 = (90/A) * 2A - 5 * 2A.
90 = 180 - 10A.

Now, rearrange the equation to solve for 10A:
10A = 180 - 90.
10A = 90.

Divide by 10:
A = **9 km/hr**.

Anirudh's initial speed is **9 km/hr**.

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{9 km/hr}}$.

### Problems based on Train, Boat, and Stream

**Q37) A swimmer can swim downstream at 40 km/hr and upstream at 26 km/hr. What is the speed of the swimmer in still water?**
**A) 33 km/hr B) 26 km/hr C) 42 km/hr D) 40 km/hr**

**Detailed Solution:**

Let the speed of the swimmer in still water be 'S' km/hr. 🏊
Let the speed of the stream (current) be 'C' km/hr. 🌊

Given:
Downstream speed = 40 km/hr.
Downstream speed = Speed of swimmer + Speed of stream = S + C.
So, S + C = 40. (Equation 1)

Upstream speed = 26 km/hr.
Upstream speed = Speed of swimmer - Speed of stream = S - C.
So, S - C = 26. (Equation 2)

We need to find the speed of the swimmer in still water (S).
We have a system of two linear equations.
Add Equation 1 and Equation 2:
(S + C) + (S - C) = 40 + 26.
S + C + S - C = 66.
2S = 66.

Divide by 2:
S = 66 / 2 = **33 km/hr**.

The speed of the swimmer in still water is **33 km/hr**. 🥇

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{33 km/hr}}$.

### Time and Work

**Q8) A and B complete a work in 14 days. If A alone can do it in 63 days, then B alone can do it half of the same work in ______________ days.**
**A) 9 B) 36 C) 27 D) 18**

**Detailed Solution:**

Let's use the work rate concept.
Work Rate = 1 / Time taken. 🚧

Given:
A and B together complete the work in 14 days.
So, (A's rate) + (B's rate) = 1/14. (Equation 1)

A alone can do the work in 63 days.
So, A's rate = 1/63.

Substitute A's rate into Equation 1:
(1/63) + (B's rate) = 1/14.

Now, find B's rate:
B's rate = 1/14 - 1/63.
To subtract, find a common denominator for 14 and 63.
LCM(14, 63) = 126. (14 * 9 = 126, 63 * 2 = 126).

B's rate = (9/126) - (2/126).
B's rate = (9 - 2) / 126 = 7 / 126.

Simplify 7/126. Both are divisible by 7.
7 ÷ 7 = 1.
126 ÷ 7 = 18.
So, B's rate = 1/18.

This means B alone can complete the **whole work** in 18 days.

The question asks for the time B alone takes to do **half of the same work**.
If B takes 18 days for the whole work,
Then for half work, B will take = 18 days / 2 = **9 days**. 👷‍♀️

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{9}}$.

### Pipe and Cistern

**Q20) A pipe can fill a tank in 12 hours. Another pipe can empty the filled tank in 21 hours. If both the pipes are opened simultaneously, then the time (in hours) in which the tank will be half filled, is:**
**A) 28 B) 14 C) 15 D) 29**

**Detailed Solution:**

Let's define the rates of the pipes:
Filling pipe (Pipe A) fills the tank in 12 hours. Its filling rate = 1/12 tank per hour. 💧
Emptying pipe (Pipe B) empties the tank in 21 hours. Its emptying rate = 1/21 tank per hour. ⬇️

When both pipes are open simultaneously, their combined rate will be:
Combined rate = Filling rate - Emptying rate (since emptying reduces water).
Combined rate = 1/12 - 1/21.

To subtract these fractions, find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 12 and 21.
LCM(12, 21) = 84.
(12 * 7 = 84, 21 * 4 = 84).

Combined rate = (7/84) - (4/84).
Combined rate = (7 - 4) / 84 = 3 / 84.

Simplify the fraction:
3/84 = 1/28.
So, the combined rate is 1/28 tank per hour.

This means that if the tank is empty, it will be filled completely in 28 hours.
The question asks for the time to fill **half of the tank**.

Time to fill half tank = (1/2) / Combined rate.
Time = (1/2) / (1/28).
Time = (1/2) * 28.
Time = **14 hours**. ⏰

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{14}}$.

### Partnership

**Q8) X, Y and Z invest a sum in the ratio 45 : 37 : 71 respectively. If they earned total profit of ₹2,790 at the end of year, then what is the difference between the share of Y and Z?**
**A) ₹599 B) ₹620 C) ₹644 D) ₹728**

**Detailed Solution:**

Investment ratio of X : Y : Z = 45 : 37 : 71.
Total Profit earned = ₹2,790.

In partnerships, profits are divided in the ratio of investments.
Let the shares be 45k, 37k, and 71k respectively.
Total ratio parts = 45 + 37 + 71 = 153 parts.

Each part's value = Total Profit / Total Ratio Parts.
Value of 1 part = ₹2,790 / 153.

Let's divide:
2790 ÷ 153 = 18.235... (It doesn't seem to divide perfectly with whole numbers. Let me recheck the calculation).
Ah, 2790 / 153.
Try small factors. Sum of digits for 153 is 9, so divisible by 9. 153/9 = 17.
Sum of digits for 2790 is 18, so divisible by 9. 2790/9 = 310.
So, 2790 / 153 = 310 / 17.
310 divided by 17 is still not a whole number. 17 * 10 = 170, 17 * 20 = 340.
17 * 18 = 306. So 310/17 is not an integer. 🤔

Let's check the options and see if any fit. It is possible the problem implies rounding, or there's a small typo in the numbers provided in the source. Given the options are whole numbers, it should result in a whole number.

Re-checking sum of ratios: 45 + 37 + 71 = 153. Correct.
Re-checking total profit: 2790. Correct.

Let's assume there might be a calculation error in my head or a slight variation in the actual exam question vs. the text. However, adhering strictly to the source:
Value of 1 part = 2790 / 153 ≈ 18.235.

Difference between the share of Y and Z = Share of Z - Share of Y.
Difference in ratio parts = 71 - 37 = 34 parts.

Difference in share = 34 * (2790 / 153).
Difference = (34 * 2790) / 153 = 94860 / 153.

Let's perform this division:
94860 ÷ 153 = **620**.

So, the difference between the share of Y and Z is **₹620**. ✅

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{620}}$.

### Average

**Q13) The average weight of 14 boys in a class is 40.25 kg and that of the remaining 4 boys is 33.5 kg. Find the average weight (in kg, rounded off to two decimal place) of all the boys in the class.**
**A) 38.75 B) 37.75 C) 39.75 D) 40.75**

**Detailed Solution:**

Yeh ek weighted average ka problem hai. ⚖️

First group of boys:
Number of boys (n₁) = 14.
Average weight (avg₁) = 40.25 kg.
Total weight of 14 boys = n₁ × avg₁ = 14 × 40.25 = 563.5 kg.

Second group of boys:
Number of boys (n₂) = 4.
Average weight (avg₂) = 33.5 kg.
Total weight of 4 boys = n₂ × avg₂ = 4 × 33.5 = 134 kg.

Total number of boys in the class = n₁ + n₂ = 14 + 4 = 18 boys.
Total weight of all boys = (Total weight of 1st group) + (Total weight of 2nd group).
Total weight = 563.5 + 134 = 697.5 kg.

Now, calculate the average weight of all the boys:
Average weight = Total weight / Total number of boys.
Average weight = 697.5 / 18.

Let's divide:
697.5 ÷ 18 = **38.75 kg**.

The average weight of all the boys is **38.75 kg**. 📊

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{38.75}}$.

### Mensuration

**Q32) A cube of side 5 cm and a cuboid of measurements 35 cm,15 cm and 15 cm, respectively, of the same metal are melted and made into cubes of side 10 cm each. The number of cubes of side 10 cm thus formed is:**
**A) 9 B) 10 C) 7 D) 8**

**Detailed Solution:**

Jab bhi koi solid melt karke doosra solid banate hain, unka **volume** same rehta hai. 🧊➡️📦

First, calculate the volume of the initial cube:
Side of cube = 5 cm.
Volume of cube = (Side)³ = 5³ = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125 cm³.

Next, calculate the volume of the cuboid:
Length (l) = 35 cm.
Breadth (b) = 15 cm.
Height (h) = 15 cm.
Volume of cuboid = l × b × h = 35 × 15 × 15.
15 × 15 = 225.
Volume of cuboid = 35 × 225 = 7875 cm³.

Total volume of metal available = Volume of cube + Volume of cuboid.
Total volume = 125 + 7875 = 8000 cm³.

Now, these are melted to form new cubes.
Side of new cube = 10 cm.
Volume of one new cube = (Side)³ = 10³ = 10 × 10 × 10 = 1000 cm³.

To find the number of new cubes formed:
Number of cubes = Total volume of metal / Volume of one new cube.
Number of cubes = 8000 cm³ / 1000 cm³ = **8**. 📏

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{8}}$.

### Trigonometry

**Q33) A ladder leans against a wall, making an angle of 30° with the ground. If the ladder is 8 m long, what is the height it reaches on the wall?**
**A) 4 m B) 6 m C) 10 m D) 8 m**

**Detailed Solution:**

Let's visualize the scenario. 🪜
Imagine a right-angled triangle is formed.
The ladder is the hypotenuse.
The wall is the opposite side (perpendicular) to the angle with the ground.
The ground is the adjacent side (base).

Given:
Angle with the ground (θ) = 30°.
Length of the ladder (Hypotenuse) = 8 m.
We need to find the height it reaches on the wall (Opposite side).

Which trigonometric ratio connects the Opposite side and the Hypotenuse?
It's **Sine** (sin θ = Opposite / Hypotenuse).

So, sin(30°) = Height on wall / Length of ladder.
sin(30°) = Height / 8.

We know that sin(30°) = 1/2.
So, 1/2 = Height / 8.

To find Height, multiply both sides by 8:
Height = 8 × (1/2).
Height = **4 m**. ⬆️

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{4 m}}$.

### Height and Distance

**Q15) From a point 15 m away from the base of a tree, the angle of elevation to the top is 45°. What is the height of the tree?**
**A) 10 m B) 18 m C) 15 m D) 12 m**

**Detailed Solution:**

Let's sketch this situation. 🌳
This forms a right-angled triangle.
The distance from the base of the tree is the Adjacent side (Base).
The height of the tree is the Opposite side (Perpendicular).
The angle of elevation is the angle formed with the ground.

Given:
Distance from base (Adjacent) = 15 m.
Angle of elevation (θ) = 45°.
We need to find the Height of the tree (Opposite).

Which trigonometric ratio connects the Opposite and Adjacent sides?
It's **Tangent** (tan θ = Opposite / Adjacent).

So, tan(45°) = Height of tree / Distance from base.
tan(45°) = Height / 15.

We know that tan(45°) = 1.
So, 1 = Height / 15.

To find Height, multiply both sides by 15:
Height = 15 × 1.
Height = **15 m**.

Since the angle is 45°, it's an isosceles right triangle. So, base and height are equal.
Simple hai! 😄

The final answer is $\boxed{\text{15 m}}$.
